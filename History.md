0.5.2 / 2010-10-05 
==================

  * Added; Text introduces newlines to mimic the grammar.
    Whitespace handling is a little tricky with this sort of grammar.
    Jade will now mimic the written grammar, meaning that text blocks
    using the "|" margin character will introduce a literal newline,
    where as immediate tag text (ex "a(href='#') Link") will not.

    This may not be ideal, but it makes more sense than what Jade was     
    previously doing.

  * Added `Tag#text` to disambiguate between immediate / block text

==================

  * Added `- each` support for readable iteration
